              We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010 with the
              goal of breaking all barriers that traders and investors face in
              India in terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the
              company Zerodha, a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit
              word for barrier.
